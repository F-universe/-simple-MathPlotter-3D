3D Function Plotter (Prototype)
3D Function Plotter is a basic web app that allows you to visualize mathematical functions of two variables (x and y) in 3D. This version is a simple prototype and may not accurately represent more complex functions.

Features
Plot simple 3D surfaces defined by a function of x and y.
Interactive 3D graphs using Plotly.js.
Easy-to-use interface: input a function and generate a 3D plot with one click.
Limitations
This is an early prototype and may not handle complex functions or edge cases. It is designed for basic mathematical expressions like x^2 + y^2, but more advanced functions might not render correctly.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/3d-function-plotter.git
Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Input a function of x and y (e.g., x^2 + y^2) and click "Plot Function" to visualize the 3D graph.
Example Functions
x^2 + y^2
sin(x) * cos(y)
x * y
